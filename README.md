## Overview

The **wick-a11y** is a Cypress plugin designed for performing configurable accessibility tests. It allows you to easily incorporate accessibility checks into your End-to-End tests, log detailed information in the Cypress log, and generate HTML documents with screenshots of each violation for easier identification and resolution of accessibility issues, all out-of-the-box.

Also provides audible information for accessibility issues at the suite level, test level, violation type level, and DOM element level, helping users identify issues through voice feedback.
